                                of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the
                                browser
                                type, language preference, referring site and the date and time of each visitor
                                request.
                                Made Label's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to
                                better
                                understand how Made Label's visitors use its website. From time to time, Made Label
                                may
                                release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing
                                a
                                report on trends in the usage of its website. Made Label also collects potentially
                                personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged
